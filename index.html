      <p> Just to mention, if you think video games are bad for us just read the paragraph below </p>
      <br>
      <p> Numerous studies have shown that video games have a positive effect to your mental health and well being, Psychology Today states that video games like first person shooters example Call of Duty and the half-life franchise help improve hand eye coordination and quick reflexes among players, also choice based games like The Walking Dead and life is strange give players a better sense of self and improved emotional stability not to mention the fact that schools and universities have used games such as portal and Minecraft to teach subjects from physics to even chemistry, Video games could be a valuable tool to the education system if only the media would stop harping on it all the time. </p>

      <p> I hope you don't see the dark side but you see the bright side...................</p>
